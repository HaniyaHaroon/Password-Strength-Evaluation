# Password Strength Evaluation

## Overview
- This project is part of a cybersecurity lab task focused on understanding what makes a password strong and how to evaluate password strength using online tools.
- By testing multiple passwords with varying complexity, we analyzed how length, symbols, numbers, and mixed cases contribute to stronger passwords.

---

## Objective
- Create multiple passwords with varying strength levels.
- Test each password using **passwordmeter.com** and similar tools.
- Record the scores, feedback, and observations.
- Understand the factors affecting password strength.

---

## Tools Used
- [Password Meter] (https://passwordmeter.com)
- [Security.org] (https://www.security.org/...)
- [Bitwarden-style tester] ((https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/...)

## Key Learnings
1. **Longer passwords** are exponentially stronger.
2. **Mixing uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols** greatly improves strength.
3. Avoid using **dictionary words** or **personal information**.
4. Password strength tools highlight weaknesses like repetition or predictability.

## Sample Passwords Tested
| Password | Type | Result Summary |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Security'123' | Strong | Common word + short length |
| 'Secur!ty2025' | Very Strong | Mix of cases + symbols |
| MySecureP@ss!' | Very Strong | Good entropy, sufficient length |
| 'S#t7!hNpQ2$' | Excellent | High complexity and randomness |
| 'M@rbl3$L!on2025#' | Excellent | High complexity and randomness |
